  <h1>Welcome to Letosphere</h1>
  <p>The goal of this game is to create words using a 5x5 grid of letters. This comes with a twist, however. When you make a word, the letters disappear and others fall into place! Different letters are valued based on the rarity in the dictionary, however these letters will also show up more often. Prepare your mind, good luck, and most of all, have fun!!</p>
